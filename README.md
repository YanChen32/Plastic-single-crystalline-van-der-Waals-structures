Intrinsic plasticity and deformability in bulk inorganic semiconductors are particularly desired at ambient conditions for the fabrication of flexible electronic devices. Most bulk inorganic semiconductors are intrinsically brittle. Very recently, several intrinsic plastic bulk inorganic semiconductors are discovered, e.g. Ag2S, Î²-InSe, CrI3, CrCl3, etc. Here, high-throughput calculations and screening of vdW layered crystals for potential plastic semiconductors are performed. From open-source 2D crystal database 2DMatPedia, we model bilayer crystals and then calculate the corresponding deformability factor.
